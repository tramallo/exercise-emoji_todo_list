## Exercise emoji TODO list

### Objetive: Html, Css & JS practice
The proposal for this exercise is to a create a webpage that holds a list of TODOs where the user can create/delete entries.

Requirements:
- This webpage must have a search bar that receives daily routine activities such as "eat", "run", "walk pet" and "sleep", among others
- A button "add" that will show the emoji corresponding to the entered activity under the search bar.
- If more that 1 activity is added, it must show them in a list
- When clicking an emoji (activity), it must be removed from the list
